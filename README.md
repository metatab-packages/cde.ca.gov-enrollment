Enrollment by school and demographic group for the years 2007 to 2018. The upstream dataset
has enrollment data files for yearlier years, as early as 1981, but these files have a different 
structure.


## Caveats

The download page includes this note: 

    Note these data files contain enrollment data for primary enrollments only. 
    It does not include short-term enrollments. For data on short-term enrollments, 
    please refer to the Primary and Short-term Enrollment by School data files. 

Some of the annual files have a Race/Ethincity code of '8', which corresponds to 
"Multiple or No Response" in he 1998 to 2006 file structure, but is not defined
for this set of files.
